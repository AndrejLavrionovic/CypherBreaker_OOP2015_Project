The field of cryptanalysis is concerned with the study of cyphers, having as its objective
the identification of weaknesses within a cryptographic system that may be exploited to
convert encrypted data (cypher-text) into unencrypted data (plain text). Whether using
symmetric or asymmetric techniques, cryptanalysis assumes no knowledge of the correct
cryptographic key or even the cryptographic algorithm being used.

Assuming that the cryptographic algorithm is known, a common approach for breaking a cypher
is to generate a large number of keys, decrypt a cypher-text with each key and then examine
the resultant plain text. If the text looks similar to English, then the chances are that
the key is a good one. The similarity of a given piece of text to English can be computed
by breaking the text into fixed - length substrings, called n-grams, and then comparing
each substring to an existing map of n-grams and their frequencies. This process does not
guarantee that the outputted answer will be the correct plain text, but should give a good
approximation that may well be the right answer.
